   - ✅ FastAPI setup with CORS
   - ✅ Database models (User, Project, Image)
   - ✅ Authentication endpoints
   - ✅ Celery task processing
   - ✅ S3 storage service

2. Missing/Incomplete
   - ❌ Password reset functionality
   - ❌ Email verification
   - ❌ Rate limiting
   - ❌ Comprehensive error handling
   - ❌ Testing suite

### Frontend
1. Core Features
   - ✅ Authentication context
   - ✅ Protected routes
   - ✅ Image generation interface
   - ✅ Basic error handling

2. Missing/Incomplete
   - ❌ Registration page
   - ❌ Main application layout
   - ❌ Project management interface
   - ❌ User settings
   - ❌ Navigation components

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. Complete Authentication Flow
   - Registration page implementation
   - Protected layout with navigation
   - User profile/settings

2. Project Management
   - Project creation interface
   - Project listing page
   - Project settings/deletion

3. Core Layout
   - Main navigation bar
   - Sidebar component
   - User dropdown menu
   - Dashboard layout

### Medium Priority
1. Error Handling & UX
   - Loading states
   - Error boundaries
   - Form validations
   - Success/error notifications

2. Testing & Documentation
   - Unit tests setup
   - Integration tests
   - Component documentation
   - API documentation

## Technical Debt
1. Backend
   - Missing comprehensive error handling
   - No test coverage
   - Basic input validation
   - No monitoring setup

2. Frontend
   - No proper state management
   - Missing loading states
   - Basic error handling
   - No component tests

## Next Logical Step
Based on our current state, the most logical next step is to complete the authentication flow by:

1. Implementing the registration page
2. Creating the main application layout with navigation
3. Setting up the protected dashboard layout
4. Adding user profile/settings functionality

This will provide a complete authentication experience and the necessary structure for the rest of the application.
